## Port Scanner in Python

This script is a simple port scanner that allows you to check for open ports on a given IP address. It uses Python's built-in socket library to scan a range of ports and report which ones are open, it will then print out any open ports and retrieve any data available on those ports using the Grabber class. 


## Requirements

Python 3.x


## Usage

To use the script, simply run the `port_scanner.py` file with Python:


By default, the script will scan all ports between 1 and 65,535 on the local machine (localhost). You can specify a different IP address to scan by passing it as a command line argument:

```bash
python3 port_scanner.py <ip_address>
```
## Output
The script will output a list of open ports, along with any response received from each port. If no response is received, the output will indicate that the port is not responding.
